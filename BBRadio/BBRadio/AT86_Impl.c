/**

 * @author Pavlo Manovi
 * @brief Contains the implementation of methods used to interact with the AT86.
 * 
 * This implementation takes the hardware abstractions defined for the target MCU/Board
 * and uses them to work with the AT86.
 * 
 * The intended design is that an SPI library with the normal IO operations will be exposed
 * as a generic SPI device and that this library will hook into that and define callback
 * functions for the SPI methods.
 * 
 * TODO: Figure out how to also support the 433 MHz band that the AT86 supports.  Requires
 * a hardware change on the ISM Blasta board.  (V2 change)
 *
 *
 * NOTE: Please do not include any hardware specific peripheral logic in AT86_Impl.c, put
 *       it in the Glue library.

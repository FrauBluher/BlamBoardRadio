/*
 * This header contains all of the other header files necessary to interact with peripherals

 *
 * Here is where we also glue together a few types to work with my pseudo hardware agnostic
 * peripheral device scheme that I use between projects.  Think 'FooDev'
 *
 * If using atmel start to set up peripherals (you should, it's easy) make sure to initialize
 * the glue library after the Atmel Start init code (usually called from main.c to driver_init.c).
